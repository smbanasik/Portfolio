            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I'm a recent computer science graduate with a focus on software engineering and embedded systems. 
            I'm passionate about exploring low-level optimization and understanding the full stack of a system. 
            I thrive when faced with challenging problems, applying a hardworking and detail-oriented mindset 
            to find solutions. I'm currently looking for roles that allow me to leverage and grow my skills—
            particularly in graphics or systems development.
            </p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
            Academically, I focused on low-level topics such as operating systems, computer architecture, 
            and compiler design, with additional interests in machine learning and algorithm analysis. 
            I applied these interests in my thesis, where I characterized the memory footprint of a large language model 
            in a CPU-only environment. Outside of academia, I’ve built a Vulkan-based game engine and have been 
            exploring other technologies, such as React. Before college, I was involved in Boy Scouts, and I’ve 
            always enjoyed hiking and biking in my free time.
            </p>

            <h2>Current Work</h2>
            <p>
            I'm currently working on several smaller projects to build out my GitHub portfolio. This website is one such project, 
            along with a collection of C++ utility libraries, tools for automating desktop workflows, and exercises 
            to explore other languages and paradigms.
            </p>
